# Introduction

Welcome to our Engineering Documentation! This documentation site serves as a comprehensive guide to our application and includes detailed release notes for each version.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several main sections:

- **Getting Started**: Basic setup and configuration guides
- **Features**: Detailed documentation of application features
- **Release Notes**: Year-wise organized release notes

## Automated Release Notes

Our release notes are automatically generated through an AI workflow when a new release is created. These notes are organized by year and version, making it easy to track changes and updates over time.
